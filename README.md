#Dracula Theme for Estuary (Kodi 18)

1. Save this to `C:\Program Files\Kodi\addons\skin.estuary\colors\`
2. In Kodi, go to `Settings > Interface > Colors` and select `Dracula`

To modify the xml, change the colors, use the normal hex value and prepend it with a single hex value for transparency -- e.g. `00282a36` is transparent, where `FF282a36` is opaque. 

Enjoy!
